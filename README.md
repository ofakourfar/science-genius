# Science Genius

Science Genius add-on for SMART Notebook®.<br/>
Copyright © 2016 Omid Fakourfar and SMART Technologies.

This is an add-on to facilitate the Science Genius Rap Battle programme. It helps students  write
rap lyrics based on scientific concepts, offering them syllable counting and a rhyming dictionary as
support tools. Students can time-synchronise their lyrics with a chosen soundtrack, quickly create a
multimedia presentation (with Giphy and Bing Image Search) and edit it with SMART Notebook’s
existing tools.
